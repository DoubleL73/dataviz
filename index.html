            I did what no presenter should ever do: I watched my own talk.<br/><br/>My first visit to OpenVis Conf in 2013.

            Here are all 5,040 words of my talk.

            And here are all the fillers I used in those 30 minutes.

            I almost exclusively used these three fillers. Um's and Ah's made up over 80%, with Uh's trailing behind.

            <div class="title">Piechart p2</div>
            I hoped that all these blunders were toward the beginning of my talk. And the data suggests that fewer fillers are used as I get into it. Perhaps the talk started out rough and improved as I found my groove.

            Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.
